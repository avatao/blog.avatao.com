One of the most difficult parts in IT security is to get started. There are zillions of interesting topics all around, but if you are completely new in this area you can easily get lost. Fortunately, there are a massive number of security tools online that help you to solve complex problems faster and easier even if you do not understand all the backgrounds. Distributions like [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), for example, are heavily armoured by the most recent security tools to help you automatize your daily routines in penetration testing. Such tools, however, are not only for beginners.

As [Charlie Miller said in his interview](https://blog.avatao.com/Interview-Charlie-Miller/) "security is best learned by doing." Today, everybody is using security tools, because we do not have time to implement everything from scratch. At the same time, if a new problem emerges someone is going to release a tool very soon. These tools are among the key driving forces of IT security. Experts like [j00ru](https://blog.avatao.com/Interview-Mateusz-Jurczyk/) use all the classics such as [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) or [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda). Top CTF teams such as [CyKor](https://blog.avatao.com/Interview-CyKor/) heavily use [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler), [Paros](http://tools.kali.org/web-applications/paros) and [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/) for web challenges. Long story short, tools are essential in IT security. 

**All right, I have tools, but how can I try them out?**

As the question above says another problem is that the **use case** (e.g., network traffic to analyze a problem, memory snapshot to find a specific code loading technique) is missing most of the time. If we lack such use cases, the tool and the corresponding problem cannot be understood well. Creating such use cases, however, is time consuming and  requires substantial expertise. 

We now launch tutorials called [avataoTools](https://avatao.com/#/tools) for various security tools with **real use cases** to help people to get familiar with the tools needed to solve IT security problems. All the tutorials are created by field experts and provide a step-by-step description for a problem that a given tool tackles. These preconfigured use cases (e.g., files, prepared environments) highlight the features and advantages of these tools and prepare the users to apply these tools later on. 

Our first tutorials drive you through a handful of security tools:

- the [Unicorn CPU emulator framework](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/8e720072-9169-4d4c-9569-c330ce7fd947), 
- the [sqlmap utility to exploit a massive range of SQL injection vulnerabilities](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/f2514fd7-689a-4156-86c2-bf47fcf80baf), and 
- the [John the Ripper password cracker utility](https://platform.avatao.com/paths/93d404f9-47fc-4382-bc75-7fe4b4947095). 

Wireshark and nmap tutorials are coming soon. 

Comment if you have suggestions for other interesting tools! We are looking forward to your feedback.
