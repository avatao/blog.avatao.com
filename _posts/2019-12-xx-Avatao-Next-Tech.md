## Why Avatao Next?

Well, let's start from the very beginning. Avatao is a security training company the provides really cool - biased personal opinion :) - containerized challenges and tutorials to transform companies from the stalled, pale and chaotic plane of security ignorance to a much better place where security is handled with the proper state of mind and responsibility. To achive this, we built a platform with hundreds of security exercises that help developers to hone their skills in a really hands-on and hopefully joyful way. At the same time, we implemented some basics features for managers to see the progress of their organization. That is it. 

Avatao was always well-known for its reliability and the huge effort we invested into creating relevant challenges that help understand application security from zero to hero. That sounds really cool, however, as time went on we had to learn - sometimes painfully and slowly, but that is journey. Actually, we learnt a lot from our clients, failures, successes, investors, friends and our "competitors". Without them, we couldn't have taken a huge progress in our way of thinking to change something that didn't work in the past. So what was it?

## The problem?

In the early dawn of Avatao in 2014, when we were sitting in one of the rooms of [CrySyS Lab](https://crysys.hu) at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary - huge thanks [Levi](https://www.crysys.hu/member/buttyan) for hosting us - , we didn't really know anything about how to build a real product for real clients. We had no idea about target personas or go-to-market strategies. Yepp, we were babies in business. We - [Mark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felegyhazi/), [Levi](https://www.crysys.hu/member/buttyan) and [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaborpek/) had, however, cumulatively tens of years of experience in IT security that was enough to realize that application security educations is a big failure globally and it is time to make a change. Existing platforms and training delivery methods were neither cost-effecitve nor scalable enough to meet the needs of millions of people writing insecure code every day. Building a platform is not a problem of course, however, building a product the succeeds is a totally different story. Due to the lack of experience, infance of security market and so on, we ended up creating a platform that is "good for all" which means it is really good for anyone. While building the old platform we focused on outputs (i.e., features) with no clear personas instead of outcomes  \[1\].  Naturally, this resulted in complex access control, irrelavant features and a pile of requirements that our clients really wanted, but we couldn't build in time. All in all, we had to realize that it is quite difficult to make real changes in the code and as a result in the security culture of our clients. But what changes?

1. Static learning paths: In the old platform we have static learning paths that are really great for continuous learning. However, we had to face the fact that companies will now learn something if there is no real trigger point. At the same time, we realized that developers really enjoy Hackthons and CTFs that is lead by a security champion/instrcutor and sit down together to have fun.  


## What's now?

We had long debates how to move forward to resolve this vicious circle. We made a hard decision to start everything from scratch that resol
